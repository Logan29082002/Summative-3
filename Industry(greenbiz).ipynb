Kinko's is purchasing green power for stores in states across the country. The city of Chicago obtains one-fifth of its electricity from green power sources.\nOther award winners included Advanced Micro Devices, Austin, Texas; state of New Jersey; Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pa.; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa.; Johnson & Johnson (select facilities in Calif., Texas, and N.J.), and the county of Alameda, Calif. in Santa Rita Jail.\n\"These efforts to support clean, renewable energy show that environmental stewardship can also mean good business,\" said EPA Administrator Christie W…","_deepnote_index_column":"2823"},{"heading":"\nCan Oil Giants and Green Energy Mix?\n","body":"=","_deepnote_index_column":"2824"},{"heading":"\nShell Helps Dutch Town Become World's First Solar City\n","body":"Madurodam, in The Hague is full of movement and light.

Spelling out the words \"Solar City\" in blue and yellow, a 300m2 bank of photovoltaic panels supplies the energy demands of the entire theme park, or about 100,000 kilowatts per annum.\nOne of the project's aims is for people to become more aware of the potential of solar energy.

Marketing the Revolution in Clean Energy\n","body":"The clean energy movement has shown steady progress in the marketplace -- yet solar and wind combined account for less than 1% of the nation's electricity production. This is partly because renewables are still more expensive than traditional energy sources, but partly because mainstream consumers still haven't been convinced of their advantages. It's up to the trendsetters to persuade the rest of America that the alternative energy movement is just alternative enough to go mainstream.

With all its technological novelty and timely political implications, the Dell and Winston Solar Challenge (named for the computer and cigarette companies that sponsored it) might have been a grand public spectacle.

The device is expected to remove 99.99% of the particulate matter released during coal combustion, easing the haze and respiratory problems caused by the tiny ash particles.\nExpected emissions from the plant, with the new pollution-control system working properly, are less than 0.007 pounds per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Clean air standards for the region limit particulate emissions to 0.03 pounds per BTU.\nThe new technology combines the best feature of the two most common pollution control systems used to reduce particulate emissions from power plants, baghouses and electrostatic precipitators.
