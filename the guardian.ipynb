Capturing the carbon emissions from biomass power plants would then effectively create “negative carbon emissions”, according to Drax.The green groups have disputed these claims and warned that the plans “will be costly” and “will not deliver negative emissions” after accounting for the full carbon footprint of biomass in the power sector.“At the same time, it…","_deepnote_index_column":"689"},{"headline":"Coles shuns coal: supermarket giant vows to source all its electricity from renewables by 2025","date":"2021-03-19T01:01:07+0000","author":"Unknown","content_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/19/coles-shuns-coal-supermarket-giant-vows-to-source-all-its-electricity-from-renewables-by-2025","article_body":"The supermarket giant Coles has pledged to source all its electricity from renewable sources across its brands by 2025 after signing another agreement to buy clean power from a Victorian windfarm.The move means all three of Australia’s major supermarkets, including Woolworths and Aldi, will be sourcing all their electricity from renewables by 2025 at the latest.Climate change campaigners said the announcement showed a significant shift was occurring across Australia’s corporate landscape.Coles Group’s chief executive, Steven Cain, told Guardian Australia the commitment, which builds on the group’s previous deals to buy renewable power, was responding to calls from staff and customers but also shareholders and investors.“There’s no doubt that in out shareholder meetings people are asking more questions about sustainability because investors around the world – who themselves have investors – are asking, are we putting our money to work in a responsible fashion,” he said. “There’s more m…","_deepnote_index_column":"690"},{"headline":"Will a British bioelectric hybrid plane really take off?","date":"2021-03-18T06:00:21+0000","author":"Unknown","content_url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/18/will-a-british-bioelectric-hybrid-plane-really-take-off","article_body":"In the shadows of the old Spitfires and Hurricanes that helped win the Battle of Britain, Faradair, a UK startup operating from the historic Duxford airfield, is hoping to help Britain fight the new war against climate change by developing a revolutionary 18-seat bioelectric hybrid plane which will eventually, hopes its designer, be carbon neutral.The plane, currently in development, will use electric motors to power take-off and landing, the part of any flight with the highest noise and carbon emissions. Once cruising, at a speed of about 230mph, the plane will switch to its turbogenerator, powered by biofuel, which will also recharge the motors with assistance from solar panels, ready for the aircraft’s descent.The short-hop bio electric hybrid aircraft (Beha), the first aircraft produced since the 1920s to have a three-winged box design, will be able to operate cargo, passenger and special operation flights.

Energy experts remain starkly divided on whether or not we can reach this global net zero target without nuclear power, but regardless, it remains a hard sell for pro-nuclear enthusiasts.The problems they face are the same ones that have dogged the industry for decades: ever-higher costs, seemingly inevitable delays, no solutions to the nuclear waste challenge, security and proliferation risks.The drawbacks to nuclear are compounded by the burgeoning success of renewables – both solar and wind are getting cheaper and more efficient, year after year.

His six-person startup, based just outside Madrid, has pioneered a turbine design that can harness energy from winds without the sweeping white blades considered synonymous with wind power.The design recently won the approval of Norway’s state energy company, Equinor, which named Vortex on a list of the 10 most exciting startups in the energy sector.
